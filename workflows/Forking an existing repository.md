## Forking an existing repository

One of the most common methods of using GitHub is **forking** someone else's repository. You might fork a repository for a number of reasons:
* You are creating a new Jekyll site and want to use an existing Jekyll theme
* Someone has written a web app or some code that they have shared on GitHub and you would like to use and adapt it
* You are contributing to a shared project in GitHub and want to make edits, then send your changes upstream

When we work with a fork of a repository, instead of downloading a copy, we maintain a connection between the two repositories (your fork and the **upstream**), allowing you to send your edits back to the upstream repository or pull and new changes in the upstream repository into your fork. If you don't want to maintain this connection, you can download the repository and follow the instructions for "Initializing a new Git repository."

To fork and work with an existing repository:
1. Log in to your GitHub account
2. Open the GitHub repository that you would like to fork (hint: you cannot fork your own repository!)
3. In the top right corner of the page, click on the **Fork** button. Wait for the repository to copy over to your GitHub user account.

You should now have your own copy of the repository in your GitHub account. In the top left corner of the page, it should show [your-GitHub-account] / [repository-name]. 

[Next... make changes and submit pull request]

[Then... check upstream for changes and pull these into your fork]
